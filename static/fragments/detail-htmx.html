  <h3 class="font-semibold text-blue-800">What is HTMX?</h3>
  <p class="mt-2 text-blue-700 text-sm">HTMX is a lightweight library (~14kB) that lets you access modern browser features directly from HTML, rather than using JavaScript. It extends HTML with attributes like <code>hx-get</code>, <code>hx-post</code>, and <code>hx-swap</code> to make any element capable of issuing HTTP requests and updating the DOM.</p>
  <p class="mt-2 text-blue-700 text-sm">The philosophy: <em>HTML is the medium of the web, and it should be powerful enough to build modern applications.</em></p>
